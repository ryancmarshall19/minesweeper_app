# minesweeper_app
A simple minesweeper app with Java. An AI is potentially in the works.

Uh ... it's telling me to write some explanatory stuff in here, so here goes: 
if you've never played minesweeper, I'm not going to explain the game here. Maybe run the code and learn by exposure?
Other than that, there's not much to explain, so have fun :)

oh also it keeps the high scores as a text file on your computer (with the original high scores being whatever mine were when I uploaded these files)
so you're not competing against the web. Last thing -- controls.

SPACE / right click = mining a square
F / left click = flagging a square
E / C = clearing a square (mines all the unflagged squares around it if the number of flags matches the number on the square -- therefore only works on number squares)
