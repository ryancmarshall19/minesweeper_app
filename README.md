# minesweeper_app
A simple minesweeper app with Java. An AI is potentially in the works.

so I just wrote one of these readme's, then realized I made a mistake uploading the files (or maybe I did it 
right the first time and wrong this time, who knows) and somehow, in the process of deleting then reuploading
all the files, my readme got deleted. This one will recieve significantly less effort. 

github is telling me to explain the project in here, so ... it's minesweeper. if you havent played minesweeper, 
then 1, the rock you're living under must be very spacious, because you obviously haven't ventured out. 2, it's
not too complicated, but enough that I'm not going to explain it here -- maybe run the program and learn by exposure?

oh also the controls are pretty important

SPACE / right click = mine a tile

F / left click = flag a tile

C / E = clear a tile (mine all the unflagged tiles around it if the number of flags around it matches the number on the tile. Therefore only works on number tiles)


anyways, I'm the only one who's ever going to read this, but I guess I can always somehow find my way back to this page
if some improbable series of events causes me to forget how I coded the game, no longer be able to read the code, and 
no longer be able to play google's minesweeper game. I'm glad I wrote this.
